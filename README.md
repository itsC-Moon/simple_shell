As a passionate software developer, I undertook the challenging task of developing a Unix shell from scratch using the C programming language. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of system programming concepts and sharpen my problem-solving skills.



Throughout the development process, I focused on creating a feature-rich and user-friendly shell that emulates the functionality of popular Unix shells such as Bash. The key features of my Unix shell project include:



## Command Execution:
I implemented a robust command execution mechanism, allowing users to run various commands and programs seamlessly.



## Command Line Parsing:
I developed a sophisticated command line parser that efficiently handles command-line arguments, options, and redirections, providing users with flexible control over input and output streams.



## Built-in Commands: 
I implemented a set of essential built-in commands, including "cd" (change directory), , and "echo" (display messages), offering users a comprehensive toolset within the shell environment.



## Signal Handling:
I incorporated robust signal handling mechanisms, enabling the shell to respond gracefully to various signals, such as interrupt signals (SIGINT) and termination signals (SIGTERM).



## Shell Environment:
I designed the shell to provide users with a customizable environment, allowing them to set environment variables, define aliases, and personalize their shell experience.



By successfully completing this Unix shell project, I honed my programming skills, gained an in-depth understanding of Unix systems, and further developed my abilities in C programming and system-level software development.
